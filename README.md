# INdesign

![image](images/header-blog.jpg)

For my project exam June 2023 at Noroff we had to create a blog. I decided to share a passion of mine which is Sewing for my blog.

## Description

This goal of this project is to showcase the variety of skills I have learned through the two semesters at Noroff. Both the design phase, and development phase reflect the skills I have learned. I also want to showcase the method of creating a website from an idea to a design and finally the implementation. We were also tasked to use [Hotjar](https://hotjar.com/) to see how users interacted with the webpage.

[The hosted site can be seen here](https://adorable-mandazi-35b33b.netlify.app/)

### Design Phase

The design phase was to have a site which showed the blog posts for the different blog posts about sewing techniques to guides. I wanted to have a scrolling option to display posts on the front page. The design was done through [Figma](https://figma.com/) and the [prototype can be seen here.](https://www.figma.com/file/UiLwolCL6oNp8SNQaUpoze/PE?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=7w7bdxh0ZKSOpKgG-1)

### Development Phase

I wanted to showcase the knowledge and skills I had accrued during this year, with an emphasis on:

- API-calls
- API management
- URL management
- javascript
- HTML and CSS

The website was also hosted by using [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), and the API was hosted using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/).
